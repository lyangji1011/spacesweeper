Welcome to Spacesweeper.
You are an astronaut in space. Your mission is to uncover the entire map without setting off any of the explosive planets.

Left click to uncover space.
Numbers that appear will tell your how many planets are in the surrounding eight cells surrounding each respective cell.
Right click to mark a space as containing a planet.
Left clicking on a spot where a planet is present will set off a chain of explosions and the world will end.

Be careful!
The future of our universe is in your hands...
